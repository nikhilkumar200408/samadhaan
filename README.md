## 🚨 Overview

**SAMADHAAN PRO** is a state-of-the-art **Cyber-Physical Intelligence System** designed to eliminate corruption in public procurement. Unlike standard audit tools, it uses **Unsupervised Machine Learning** to detect anomalies in real-time and locks evidence onto a **local Blockchain Ledger**, creating an unalterable history of truth.

Tailored for **Delhi's Public Works Department (PWD), Jal Board, and NDMC**, this system features military-grade security simulations including 2-Factor Authentication and Restricted Access Gateways.
